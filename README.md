Monomers
========

Polymer (http://www.polymer-project.org/) is a project aimed at bringing the next generation web into today's browsers.
A focus of polymer is to build the web using web components that are versionable, reusable, and portable. This allows for a LEGO like construction of web applications.

Monomers are web components that make up Polymer apps.
